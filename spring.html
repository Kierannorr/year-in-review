<h1>Impactful things that happened to me during spring.</h1>
  <br>
  - The most obvious one is quarantine. quarantine came out of no where. Covid was just a joke at first, then all of suddon school was canceled. It did not phase me at first but being stuck in your house for over 10 weeks sucks.

  - My sister graduating college. The reason my sister graduating was impactful was becuase it really showed me how old I was.
