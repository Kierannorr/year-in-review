- At Halloween Haunt something very scary happened to me and my friends. We were hangin out in the arcade when we heard screaming "shooter" and saw people running. We all immerdiatly started running out of the park. There ended up not being a shooter but it was still a scary experence.

- I also started making new friends and getting friends back
<br>
- I learned how to code
